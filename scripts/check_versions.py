"""Verify that every shipped version string agrees.

The project declares its version in four places, each consumed by a
different distribution channel:

    pyproject.toml              the PyPI package
    uv.lock                     the locked workspace member
    manifest.json               the Claude Desktop extension
    server.json packages[]      the MCP registry's PyPI package entry

These drift silently. At the v0.8.5 release `manifest.json` and
`server.json`'s package entry were both still on 0.8.1, two releases
behind `pyproject.toml`, because the 0.8.2 bump touched only
`pyproject.toml`. Nothing failed -- the extension simply kept advertising
a version that was no longer what shipped.

`server.json`'s TOP-LEVEL "version" is deliberately excluded. That field
identifies the registry entry rather than the PyPI package and is on its
own 1.x line; forcing it to match would be a version downgrade in the
registry. Only `packages[].version`, which must match what is published
to PyPI, is checked.

Run with no arguments to check internal consistency; pass a version (or a
`v`-prefixed release tag) to additionally require that everything matches
it.
